    <h2>Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Second day into it! ++Consistency.</p>
    <p>Although I couldn't get as much done as I thought of, I'm still optimistic since I've at least been able to get my hands into it, which otherwise would have possibly been a procrastinated task</p>
    <p>Again, hoping for better coding - days!</p>
