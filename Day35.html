    <h2>Thoughts</h2>
    <p>College has become hectic, so I'll need some days off to complete my college assignments and other college semester-end necessities</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Update: Day 35 - Day 39 were the days I didn't continue my challenge on, which means that I'll add 5 extra days to the challenge:))</p>
    <p>Hoping for great learning and coding - days!</p>
